Known limitations:
    1. Each parking area does not save every data of parked cars independently

    2. Wasn't able to implement three types or parking slots: small (SP), medium (MP) and large (LP) where:
        (a) S vehicles can park in SP, MP and LP parking spaces;
        (b) M vehicles can park in MP and LP parking spaces; and
        (c) L vehicles can park only in LP parking spaces. 

    3. Wasn't able to implement vehicle leaving the parking complex and returning within one hour must be charged continuous rate

    4. Parking area is fixed to 3x3 size (parking slot)

Thank you for rendering your time on checking my simple output. Due to work constraints, I wasn't able to fully integrate the app's full funcionality and design.
